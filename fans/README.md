Randomly generated, permalinkable transition exercises for techy fan spinners!

Based on Becca Becker's [dice game](https://www.facebook.com/groups/109637431191/permalink/10154145560006192/).

## TODO
+ ~~permalinking~~
+ ~~pose mode~~
+ set uniqueness constraint on adjacent relations? (or maybe that's useful)
+ ~~probably refactor to a onepage app so I can add more toggles~~
+ ~~novice <-> combo toggle (1 vs 2 transitions)~~
+ clean up UI for larger number of dice
+ make it mobile friendly
