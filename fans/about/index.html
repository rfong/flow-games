<p>The game: pick a random sequence of fan relations and transitions, and figure out how to make 'em look good together!</p>

<p>
I'm a novice fan spinner and made this page to help me figure out what the
heck to do with my fans. Enjoy and please <a href="mailto:rhotic@alum.mit.edu">let me know</a> if you find bugs or have feature requests. Github users can directly
<a href="https://github.com/rfong/fan-dice/issues">report issues here</a>. If you spin poi, I also have a basic <a href="http://rfong.github.io/poi">poi visualization tool</a> that could use more suggestions.
